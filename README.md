# 🌦️ Challenge - Weather App

This repository contains my implementation of the Weather App Challenge, a project aimed at developing a simple Android application capable of retrieving and displaying real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API.

The application was designed to fetch meteorological information from predefined geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) representing various cities. It displays key weather data such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 🌬️ Pressure

After receiving the base project, I introduced a series of enhancements and bug fixes to improve its functionality, reliability, and user experience. These updates are detailed in the section below.
