# 🌦️ Challenge - Weather App

Welcome to the **Weather App Challenge!**
This repository contains the implementation of a simple weather application that retrieves and displays weather information using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

We use predefined latitude and longitude coordinates from various cities to fetch and display detailed weather data, such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 🌬️ Pressure
